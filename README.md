**Linear Stability Code**

This code approximates the system of linearised partial differential equations, by making use of an expansion and projection onto a basis of $N_{\theta}$ Legendre polynomials and $N_r$ Chebyshev collocation points in the radial direction. Activating an Anaconda environment with the appropriate dependencies installed `numpy, matplotlib, scipy` and then executing 

`python3 Linear_Problem.py`

computes and plots the neutral curves shown in figure 2 of (Mannix et al. JFM 202?).
